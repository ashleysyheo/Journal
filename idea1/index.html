                <p>
                    Really why is CSS so weird! Fixing CSS never ends. There's always somthing to change. 
                    And the most frustrating part is making the website look perfect for phones. 
                    It's really frustrating how the screen from developer's mode looks completely different 
                    from what you would see on real devices...

                <h4>Letter to Young Artists During a Global Pandemic</h4>
                <!-- <p>
                    I guess mainly creating projects on the web, the pandemic hasn't affected me as much. 
                    Although the time difference problem has been painful, I don't badly think of online classes. 
                    Last week one of my professor talked about how online courses could be revolutionary 
                    for students at community colleges, those who would have to drive hours to take just one class. 
                    So for them, these online zoom classes are much more beneficial in some ways.

                <p>
                    Everybody has been saying 'we should return to the way it was, we hope we can see each other in 
                    New York soon, etc.' But I like to think that the pandemic has allowed people, 
                    from all over the world, to connect, just like what the internet is doing. 
                    So is it necessary to go back to the way it was before?
