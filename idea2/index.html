                <h4>Letter to Young Artists During a Global Pandemic</h4>
                <p>
                    Everybody has been saying 'we should return to the way it was, we hope we can see each other in 
                    New York soon, etc.' But I like to think that the pandemic has allowed people, 
                    from all over the world, to connect, just like what the internet is doing. 
                    So is it necessary to go back to the way it was before?
