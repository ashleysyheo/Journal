                    <p>
                        Everybody has been saying 'we should return to the way it was, we hope we can see each other in 
                        New York soon, etc.' But I like to think that the pandemic has allowed people, 
                        from all over the world, to connect, just like what the internet is doing. 
                        So is it necessary to go back to the way it was before?

                    <p>
                        People usually think that <em>if it’s on the Web it will stay on the Web</em>, so they would use the 
                        Web to archive their memories. While the Web serves as infinite storage for information, nothing changes 
                        more rapidly than the Web. I frequently use a Korean online community, similar to Reddit, to find useful 
                        and interesting information. And whenever I see something interesting, I would keep the tabs open. So 
                        on my Chrome browser, there would be 5~10 websites opened, waiting to be seen. But sometimes, after a 
                        few days, I notice that there’s a grey circle on the right side of the tab, and when I click it, it 
                        shows an alert saying <em>We can’t find this post</em> ......
                        <br />
                        As I kept seeing this alert, it got me thinking wouldn’t it be paradoxical to expect something on the fluid 
                        and ever-changing Web to last forever? I mean, could anything last forever? What if Internet Archive and the 
                        Wayback Machine disappears? What if the Web disappears? <em>In the end, everything goes</em>.

                    <h4 class="title title4">The internet didn’t kill counterculture ...</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Web feels free, so it feels like anyone’s open to express anything that would like through social media. 
                        But even if they express different things, I feel like what they essentially want is <strong>attention</strong>. People on 
                        social media promote themselves, life, uniqueness, but how is it different from others? This almost feels 
                        pretentious. People become increasingly conscious of other people’s eyes and shape themselves to get more 
                        attention. Now even the radicalness or craziness of oneself is a common feature among people on social media. 
                        You think you’re different, but actually, you’re just one of them. So like it was mentioned to be truly 
                        countercultural today, “one has to betray the platform, which may come in the form of betraying or divesting 
                        from your public online self.”

                        “If we want something, we can make space for it” <br />
                        This is what I love about the web. If you want something, you can make it. 
                        And anybody can enjoy and be part of the experience. But while we can create anything, 
                        it's hard to share it with a larger audience. So for the website I create, it would probably 
                        only be visited by students from this class. So while "resonance and significance" all sounds 
                        good, it also makes me conflicted. Why create when no one's going to know? Is it going to be 
                        meaningful as a website if no one's going to visit again or stay on the website for some time? 
                        How is it different from having it on your hard drive? … I think it's just hard to create a purposeful 
                        and meaningful website that gets acknowledged.

                    <p>
                        I like how Jodi's works are really about the "hardware and software", the computing itself. Jodi's IDN 
                        is not necessarily telling the user what they should do on this website; it's just showing a part of the web. 
                        So I don't have to think or continuously move my cursor for interaction. Sometimes I feel like the web is 
                        overcomplicated. So while I like the fancy and beautiful websites, it's also tiring... So Jodi's websites are 
                        just nice to watch without thinking a lot. Also, the concept of Internationalised Domain Name is interesting. 
                        Then now 허서영.한글 (my Korean name.kr) could be a domain name that works on the web! But while this new invention(?) 
                        is sort of exciting, people who don't know Korean won't be able to visit this website unless they have it copied and 
                        pasted somewhere. Still, it's interesting to see how Jodi's use this to create something really intriguing.

                    <p>
                        I’ve been feeling stupid lately. I don’t know exactly how it works, but somehow it does. Certainly, technological advances 
                        have made our lives more convenient, but it also seems to make us more and more stupid. People just accept it as it is, 
                        believing that intelligent people would have created it well. 

                        So I always listen to music on YouTube, but yet I still don’t know how autoplay works. Sometimes they play the same music again, only 
                        ploaded by a different user, and sometimes it’s utterly unrelated to what I was just listening to. I’m lazy to create a playlist 
                        (what I want to listen always changes), and I always play YouTube in the background and do something else, so it’s hard for me to 
                        search and play the music every time. So sadly, I have no choice but to rely on autoplay even though it drives me crazy from time to time… 
                        <br />
                        People say that technology should continue to develop to pursue more convenience and that old fashion is not good. But is that always right? 
                        I feel like it has moved way beyond comfort and is instead becoming inconvenient and harmful in some ways. Then maybe it isn’t that absurd 
                        to imagine that robots would soon control us.

                    <p>
                        It’s interesting to see how this article relates GUI to racial issues – black and white. Before, I’ve never thought about it in this way because 
                        I thought the command line was in the black background simply to make it less stressful for the eye. And what we see when we see on the screen 
                        is presumably white to shine the light on the developer’s creation — sort of like a spotlight. But now, I don’t necessarily think GUI relates to 
                        whiteness because nowadays, there’s a dark mode for components and websites and light mode for the terminal. So it really depends on the user on 
                        how to design their experience.

                    <p>
                        It’s interesting to see how the author explains the design process and understanding through games. Of the three concepts, what interested me the most 
                        is control. From a reading I read before, it said that every game and design work are the results of a collaborative process between designer and player/user. 
                        So if a designer constructs the building block, it is the player who completes the design. A designer cannot create on his/her own. So control goes both ways. 
                        Designers will have preliminary control of the project, and the players will have control of how they will interact with that project. I think this is a vital 
                        aspect to consider when creating my own websites, how users will react and interact, and how they could contribute to the website.

                        <br />
                        Sometimes I don’t know if I opened a website to see the contents or the advertisements. What’s creepy about this is when an ad about what I searched just before pops up. 
                        I don’t know when I agreed to such terms, but at some point, I must have agreed to provide my information. And because of that “agreement” these personalised advertisements 
                        appear in front of me. Although this personalised information would only appear on my computer and on the browser logged in with my account, it’s still very creepy. It feels 
                        as if my thoughts and choices are being controlled. So rather than making my life more convenient, it feels like google (or any other) is determining my interest that I don’t even know yet.

                    <p>
                        The world has become so convenient that you don’t need to do anything. There are so many tools that can’t help you achieve what you want. 
                        There are website builders, static website generators, etc. So people don’t need to know anything about HTML or CSS anymore to become part 
                        of the web. All you need is access to the Internet and URLs. 

                        But then what’s the joy of being on the web? Because the web is full of intricate, professional, and cool websites, I just want to leave a trace of my clumsy self. 
                        I want to be the one who scribbles on the wall. I make websites for my own pleasure.

                    <p>
                        It would be really fun if we could have games for everything. But still, it’s hard to imagine how the game or spatial experience would look like. 
                        I imagined faces floating around in a 3d space or table in a Zoom meeting, and it was just weird and awkward. Would the spatial experience be more 
                        intuitive? I personally like the simplicity that one can experience online. For example, on Zoom, you don’t need to move your head around to see who’s 
                        talking. Every attendee is on one screen so that you can see everyone all at once. I also find spatial experience awkward because it feels weird to 
                        see something spatial on a 2d screen for me. Maybe this is because we aren’t used to those technologies? But personally, I like and feel comfortable 
                        with the 2d space, so I don’t feel the necessity to incorporate the spatial experience. <br>
                        + 3d on the web lags too much.

                        <em>An app is tiny</em>. So, it’s just amazing how a small app can do so many things. These days, it feels like anything can be done with an app. You can turn off 
                        the lights at your home, open your car, check your health, and so many other things with an app on your phone. However, while it may be convenient, it’s 
                        also somewhat scary. It may sound paradoxical, but although I use technology every day, I don’t really like it because it takes away what I can easily do 
                        in life. It makes me feel stupid using the app to do the most basic and easiest thing. If I built the app myself, I would have felt a sense of accomplishment. 
                        However, using apps that other people makes me dull. So even though I’ll continue to use apps, I still want to turn off the lights, open and drive the car, 
                        and do other things myself.
