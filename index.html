                    <p>
                        Everybody has been saying 'we should return to the way it was, we hope we can see each other in 
                        New York soon, etc.' But I like to think that the pandemic has allowed people, 
                        from all over the world, to connect, just like what the internet is doing. 
                        So is it necessary to go back to the way it was before?

                    <p>
                        People usually think that <em>if it’s on the Web it will stay on the Web</em>, so they would use the 
                        Web to archive their memories. While the Web serves as infinite storage for information, nothing changes 
                        more rapidly than the Web. I frequently use a Korean online community, similar to Reddit, to find useful 
                        and interesting information. And whenever I see something interesting, I would keep the tabs open. So 
                        on my Chrome browser, there would be 5~10 websites opened, waiting to be seen. But sometimes, after a 
                        few days, I notice that there’s a grey circle on the right side of the tab, and when I click it, it 
                        shows an alert saying <em>We can’t find this post</em> ......
                        <br />
                        As I kept seeing this alert, it got me thinking wouldn’t it be paradoxical to expect something on the fluid 
                        and ever-changing Web to last forever? I mean, could anything last forever? What if Internet Archive and the 
                        Wayback Machine disappears? What if the Web disappears? <em>In the end, everything goes</em>.

                    <h4 class="title title4">The internet didn’t kill counterculture ...</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Web feels free, so it feels like anyone’s open to express anything that would like through social media. 
                        But even if they express different things, I feel like what they essentially want is <strong>attention</strong>. People on 
                        social media promote themselves, life, uniqueness, but how is it different from others? This almost feels 
                        pretentious. People become increasingly conscious of other people’s eyes and shape themselves to get more 
                        attention. Now even the radicalness or craziness of oneself is a common feature among people on social media. 
                        You think you’re different, but actually, you’re just one of them. So like it was mentioned to be truly 
                        countercultural today, “one has to betray the platform, which may come in the form of betraying or divesting 
                        from your public online self.”
